# fake-profile-detection
The project aims to develop a fake profile detection model using the powerful BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language model and deep learning techniques, which can help social media platforms to identify and help remove fake accounts, enhancing the security and reliability of their platforms

This project is a deep learning-based approach to detect fake profiles on social media platforms. The project uses the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model, BERT, to analyze text-based features such as profile description, tweet content, and other user activity. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled fake and real profiles, and then it is used to predict whether a new profile is real or fake. The project also employs various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and loss to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a robust and reliable fake profile detection system that can assist social media platforms in maintaining a trustworthy user base.
